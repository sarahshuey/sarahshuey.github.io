    <p>
    Through my diverse background working with both startups and large corporations, I bring a unique view to the table.  As a fast learner, I am eager to solve problems and can thrive in a fast paced environment.
    </p>
    <p>
    When working in a diverse team, adapting to personalities is an important skill, which I have honed and have excellent emotional intelligence instincts. I enjoy working with others, complementing our strengths, and aligning people to a common goal, ultimately allowing my team to succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
    In situations that are high stress, often coupled with daunting deadlines, I rise to the occasion.  I am flexible to both lead a project and group, as well as be a team player able to take direction. I focus on my strengths, knowing that I will also learn from others on my team, allowing me to cultivate new competencies and bolster my own capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am a driven individual who exudes a strong work ethic and will be a valuable asset to your team and would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further.
